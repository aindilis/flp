# ðŸŒŸ Call to SWIPL Developers: Help Us Rebuild the Free Life Planner

Dear SWIPL community,

I'm reaching out about an ambitious project that aims to leverage the power of Prolog to make a real difference in people's lives. The Free Life Planner (FLP) is an AI-driven life management system designed to help individuals navigate complex life challenges, with a particular focus on supporting those facing poverty, illness, disability, or homelessness.

## Why We're Rebooting FLP

After years of development and real-world testing, we're planning a complete rebuild of FLP from the ground up. While the current version has proven the concept's viability, we believe that integrating modern Prolog technologies and best practices from the start will allow us to create something truly transformative.

## Technical Vision

We're looking to incorporate:
- sCASP for Event Calculus and commonsense reasoning
- Comprehensive microtheory support
- RTEC (Run Time Event Calculus) for complex event processing
- OpenCyc integration for knowledge representation
- Advanced temporal and metric planning capabilities
- Modular architecture supporting multiple reasoners

## What Makes This Project Special

FLP isn't just another software project. It's a practical application of logic programming to solve real-world problems. The system currently includes:
- Temporal metric financial planning
- AI-driven meal planning with nutrition optimization
- Comprehensive health and medication management
- Smart home integration for environmental control
- Behavioral support for executive function

## Why SWIPL Developers?

We need developers who understand:
- Modern Prolog best practices
- Knowledge representation and reasoning
- Logic-based planning and scheduling
- Complex event processing
- System architecture and integration

## Getting Involved

Whether you're interested in using FLP yourself or want to help create tools that can make a real difference in people's lives, we'd love to have you involved. We need developers who can help:
- Design clean, maintainable Prolog architectures
- Implement robust reasoning systems
- Create efficient knowledge bases
- Develop clear APIs and interfaces
- Ensure scalability and performance

## Next Steps

If you're interested in joining us in this endeavor, or would like to learn more, please reach out. We're happy to share more details about our vision, current codebase, and development plans.

The original system is available at:
- https://github.com/aindilis/free-life-planner
- https://github.com/aindilis/gourmet-formalog-standalone
- https://github.com/aindilis/financial-planning

Together, we can build something that not only showcases the power of Prolog but also makes a meaningful impact on people's lives.

Looking forward to your thoughts and potential collaboration!
