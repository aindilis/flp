-   Please note that for now there are (rather confusingly) three
    important documents to see:
    -   The [original deprecated Free Life Planner repo](https://github.com/aindilis/free-life-planner#readme) (including screenshots and links)

# Introduction


<a id="orgaba9e4c"></a>

## Purpose

-   A free/libre program for helping people with the logistics of
    daily life, helping to plan and secure things like food,
    medicine, finances, transportation, health and so on.

-   Cognitive prosthesis for executive function
    -   Including for people w/ ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, dementia, etc
-   A "life manual" / "skills for living life"


<a id="orga7d46a7"></a>

## User Base

-   This software is intended to be of general use
-   However, people facing challenges are particularly likely to benefit more
    -   with disabilities such as pervasive developmental disorders
        -   "folks do not realize that they are one fall, auto accident,
            or vascular event away from being a person with a
            disability." - Mary Hart
    -   of limited means who are one misstep from disaster
    -   with disease, illness or medical conditions
    -   who are homeless
    -   returning citizens
    -   who experience relationship violence
    -   victims of persecution and hate
    -   victims of war or political oppression
    -   victims of natural or man-made disasters and climate change
    -   immigrants and refugees
    -   other groups not here accounted for
