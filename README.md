# The Free Life Planner


<a id="org9a5a8f9"></a>

## THIS README IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION


<a id="org7c546c6"></a>

# Links

-   Please note that for now there are (rather confusingly) four
    important documents to see:
    -   The [original deprecated Free Life Planner repo](https://github.com/aindilis/free-life-planner#readme) (including screenshots and links)
    
    -   The new [ReferenceManual.md](https://github.com/aindilis/flp/blob/main/ReferenceManual.md) (the most detailed overview of FLP)
    
    -   The new [README.md](https://github.com/aindilis/flp/blob/main/README.md) (a less detailed summary and links)

-   I am going to condense these into a single document real soon now.
    -   The paper - "The Free Life Planner: A Virtual Secondary Social Safety Net" (will link to when it becomes available)
